# Microsoft Windows Registry Low/Unclear Severity Bugs

This repository contains the descriptions and proof-of-concept exploits of 21 issues with low or unclear security impact found in the Windows Registry. They were reported to Microsoft between November 2023 and February 2025. Six of them were fixed by the vendor in the March 2024 Patch Tuesday, while the other fifteen were closed as WontFix/vNext. The bugs were identified during my registry research in 2022-2025, alongside the [42 reports](https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1352808:Microsoft%20customfield1352754:mjurczyk%20created%3E2022-05-01%20created%3C2024-12-31) filed in the Project Zero bug tracker with a 90-day disclosure deadline.

For more information about the research, please see the blog post series starting with [The Windows Registry Adventure #1: Introduction and research results](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/04/the-windows-registry-adventure-1.html), as well as several conference talks I have given on the subject:

* [Exploring the Windows Registry as a powerful LPE attack surface](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/talks/bluehat-exploring-the-windows-registry-as-a-powerful-lpe-attack-surface/) (BlueHat Redmond 2023)
* [Practical Exploitation of Registry Vulnerabilities in the Windows Kernel](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/talks/offensivecon-practical-exploitation-of-windows-registry-vulnerabilities/) (OffensiveCon 2024)
